1. Go to **Plugins**, and enable **Custom CSS**
1. At the bottom of the settings window, go to **Community themes**
1. Scroll through the list of awesome themes until you find this one
1. Click **Use**.

## License
This theme is copied from Bear.app's Red Graphite theme, so it would be silly to pretend to have a license. Do as you please, all credit to the Bear designers for putting good colors together.

## More Screenshots

Note that these screenshots are from a much earlier build of Obsidian, so the UI has changed some compared to the screenshot above.
